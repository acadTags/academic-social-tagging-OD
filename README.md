Supplementary materials in the paper "Hierarchical Clustering-Based Outlier Detection
from Academic Social Tagging Data", submitted to PAKDD 2017.

This folder contains 6 materials/files: 

Material 1 The semantic assumptions and treatment for all special characters with real tag examples in Bibsonomy (referenced in “Handling special characters semantically” in Sect. 3 in the paper).

Material 2-3 The full cleaned dataset from Bibsonomy data after Step 4 (referenced in Table 1 in the paper) containing 2502 multiword tag groups (Material 2) and 14,877 single tag groups (Material 3).

Material 4 The reduced dataset after Step 5 (referenced in Table 1 in the paper) by selecting only tag groups annotated to publications, containing 15,647 multiword and single tag groups.

Material 5 The clustering results and candidate outliers with data from Material 4 represented using a binary resource-based matrix reduced to 2000 dimensions after Singular Value Decomposition.

Material 6 The candidate outliers per clustering technique (Sheet 1 from Columns A to O), distinct candidate outliers from all clustering techniques (Sheet 1 Column P), human evaluation results (Sheet 1 Columns Q to W); and precision, recall, F-measure for each clustering technique (Sheets 2 to 4).
